Project's Name: Al Dente Pizza
Overview
Al Dente Pizza is a website dedicated to providing an easy way for customers to learn about the restaurant, view the menu, make reservations, and get in touch for inquiries. The site is designed to showcase the restaurant's delicious offerings, location, and various customer service features. The goal of this website is to offer a seamless experience for users to explore the restaurant's services and place orders or inquire about the menu. The site is mobile-responsive and optimized for various devices to reach a broad audience of potential customers.

Design Process
This website aims to create a mediterranean atmosphere,with wooden background.  The target audience includes local pizza lovers, tourists, and anyone looking for a convenient way to browse the menu and interact with the restaurant. My primary goal is to make it easy for users to find information quickly and make reservations or inquiries without frustration.

To achieve this, I created a wireframe using Figma to visualize the structure of the site, which includes a homepage, menu page, contact page, and an About Us section. The layout features a clear navigation system, engaging images, and a good feedback system.
