                <p>
                    Al Dente Pizza was born from a passion for authentic, Italian-style cooking and a love for bringing people together. Antonio, who grew up surrounded by the rich flavors of his mother’s kitchen, carried that tradition with him when he moved overseas. In Singapore, he began hosting weekend dinners, experimenting with recipes, and perfecting his craft. What started as a small, private gathering grew into something more, inspiring the creation of Al Dente Pizza.

                    In 2024, Antonio opened the doors to a place that reflects his vision of warm, convivial dining—where friends, family, and new faces come together over delicious, handcrafted pizzas and unforgettable moments with us.

                His dishes stay true to Italy’s roots, using only the finest ingredients—imported directly from Italy—and crafting everything in-house, from fresh pastas and aged salumi to signature pizza doughs and homemade gelato. Antonio’s food is a celebration of Italy, made with the finest raw ingredients and an unwavering commitment to authenticity.
